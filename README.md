# 🏠 ALX Project: Next.js Airbnb Clone – Foundational Setup
This project is a Next.js-based application designed to help you learn and apply the fundamentals of modern front-end development using React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint. It mimics key features of Airbnb’s UI (like property cards, pills, buttons, and pages), focusing on clean architecture, reusable components, and best development practices.

## 📚 Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:

✅ Understand how to scaffold and structure a Next.js project with TypeScript
✅ Implement basic routing using the Pages Router (not App Router)
✅ Create reusable, dynamic React components with props and interfaces
✅ Manage static assets and apply utility-first styling with Tailwind CSS
✅ Learn how to compose UIs using modular components like Card, Pill, and Button
✅ Gain experience using TypeScript interfaces for strong type safety
✅ Configure and use ESLint for maintaining code quality and consistency
✅ Implement responsive layouts following design system principles  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 🚦 Key Features & Implemented Tasks
### ✅ Basic Routing

-Created pages/landing.tsx and pages/about.tsx

-Implemented simple navigation using Next.js Pages Router

### ✅ Reusable Components

-Built a Card component with Tailwind styling

-Created a Pill component with a title prop for reusability

-Developed a flexible Button component with title and styles props

-Demonstrated reusability by rendering multiple component instances dynamically

### 🧪 How to Run the Project Locally
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/alx-project-0x00-setup.git
cd alx-project-0x00-setup

2. Install Dependencies
npm install

4. Run the Development Server
npm run dev -- -p 3000

6. Open in Browser
Visit http://localhost:3000/landing
Visit http://localhost:3000/about
### 🧹 Code Quality & Conventions
✅ Strict TypeScript typing using React.FC and interfaces

✅ Reusable components with props for flexibility

✅ Utility-first styling via Tailwind CSS

✅ ESLint enforced consistent syntax, spacing, and practices

✅ Clean and maintainable modular architecture

### 🎯 Best Practices Followed
-Structure Clear separation of components, interfaces, and pages

-Reusability Components are designed for multiple use cases with props

-Consistency Tailwind for consistent styling, spacing, and layout

-Type Safety: All components are typed using TypeScript interfaces

-Linting ESLint configured for a cleaner, error-free codebase

-Performance: Leveraging Next.js optimisations and code-splitting

### 🚀 Next Steps / Future Enhancements
-Integrate Next.js App Router in future modules

-Add dynamic data loading and property listings

-Integrate Next.js Image optimisation

-Connect backend APIs or use mock data for listings

-Implement navigation bar, footer, and search filters
